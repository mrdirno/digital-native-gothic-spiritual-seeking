## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'ghost' not in a haunted house, but in a corrupted digital file, a glitching AR filter, or the persistent echo of a deleted social media account.
- Create a profile for a modern 'spiritual guide' who operates outside traditional frameworks—a hacker, a librarian of weird podcasts, a curator of forgotten web forums, or a park ranger who knows the secret network of ley lines under the city.
- Imagine a 'thin place' in the digital native world: a server farm that hums with unnatural resonance, a forgotten subreddit where prayers are answered, or an abandoned mall where the Muzak sometimes whispers truths.
- Write a dialogue between a pragmatic, tech-optimist parent and their child who is beginning to see the world as layered, haunted, and spiritually porous. How does each defend their worldview?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Digital Scrying' tool: a web app that uses your camera and computer vision to overlay 'ghostly' glitches, text fragments, or spectral figures onto reflections in real-time video, simulating the protagonist's perception.
- Create a generative text 'Palimpsest Engine' that layers fragments of old folklore, modern tech manuals, and personal diary entries, allowing users to 'scrape' between layers to reveal a hidden narrative.
